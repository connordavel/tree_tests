project: fireflies

Connor Davel
CSCI4229 2022


Demonstrates how to draw a scene

running the program:
>> make
>> ./project

Key bindings
  arrows     Change view angle
  w/a/s/d    change x and y view position
  ESC        Exit


Sources:
No outside sources used. All code is from in-class examples,
especially example 8 for things like window resizing, drawing lines/axes,
drawing a sphere, etc. 

What still needs to be done:
I am not happy with the night lighting, which needs a new sky box. I would like to add a 
flash light or lantern that the fireflies will swarm around when turned on. I will also add a
fence around the trees. I will also add better speed control so that the fireflies do not
speed up on faster systems.

I could not figure out how to implement a compute shader, so I have added that as a stretch
goal if I get to it. But, by far the biggest bottleneck in fps are the 2 trees in the middle,
which I am trying to make more efficient. 

Time to Complete:
about 50+ hours so far
